## Overview

### Description

GARAGE is an app that allows a user to decrease clutter in their house by putting items up for sale. This app allows users to maintain an inventory of items they want to sell, and gives them the option to actually sell those items as well. For a user that is looking to buy an item, there is also a browse page, in which users can filter their what they are looking for, and can then buy items that other users have put up for sale.

## Current Progress

TODO: start sale button sometimes doesn't do all of the items -- i think it's because the asynchronous pushing of the updated item to the database is finishing faster than the for loop gets to the next time
